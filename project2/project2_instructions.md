# Project 2 Instructions

## Overview

For this project, you will be playing the role of a freelance data scientist. Your job is to find an interesting dataset that enables you to make a valuable data product - in this case a classification model. You will be responsible for finding the data and the value without much guidance or oversight.

## Expectations

For this project you may research and collaborate as you see fit, but your code must by your own. This means you may consult fellow students in completing it, as well internet resources like standard documentation and stackoverflow. However, you are not permitted to copy code or data sets from each other.

## Turning in

Please export your notebook including code and outputs to an .html file and turn in through canvas by April 12 at or before midnight.

## Project directions

1. Pick a dataset of interest to you (or create one). It should contain:
	a. At least 20,000 rows.
	b. A binary target (classification), in which a model would be useful.
	c. At least 5 features, at least one of which is non-numeric.
2. Perform basic exploratory data analysis, and write an executive summary of the data for me. That is, write a short paragraph explaining what the data is along with any characteristics that are important from a machine learning or business perspective.
3. Fit three different models on the data:
	a. A logistic regression classifier.
	b. A tree-based classifier (e.g. GBM, RF, etc.)
	c. A deep neural network. 
4. Find the model with the highest AUC - what is it?
5. Create a pitch for your product. That is, write a summary of how the model would provide value to a business or consumer.
