The notebooks in this directory are aimed at introducing the functionality of pytorch in settings we already understand (linear regression and logistic regression) in a progressively more "pytorchy" way. That is, we start by doing things "manually" in numpy and then progressively introduce pytorch functionality to make our life easier. These notebooks closely follow the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M).
