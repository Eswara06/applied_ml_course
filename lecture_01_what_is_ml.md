# What is ML?

The answer to the question "What is ML?" will undoubtedly depend on who you ask. Instead of trying to provide a completely coherent language or ontology for ML, I will merely attempt to provide a descriptive one that gives you a mental framework for mapping tools to problems. If you find yourself observing that certain things that I have described as different are really special cases of each other - congratulations and your welcome. These are after all my favorite type of observations.

## Three tasks

I will describe machine learning as falling into three tasks:

1. Describing a labelled structure in data (supervised learning).
2. Describing an unlabelled structure in data (unsupervised learning).
3. Building agents that learn from experience (reinforcement learning).

Before diving into more formal definitions - let's consider (lots of) examples:

### Looking for bots.

### Looking for fraud.

### Recommending ads.

### Recommending articles.

### Predicting approvals.

### Playing chess.

### Representing a user.

### Creating an audience.

### Teaching a class.

## Supervised learning

### Classification

### Regression

## Unsupervised learning

### Clustering

### Learning generating distributions

### Topological data analysis

## Reinforcement learning

### The MDP setup

### Bandit problems

### Success in game playing
